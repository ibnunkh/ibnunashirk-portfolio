                Graduated from SMA Istiqamah Bandung. I began my career journey as a
                freelance video editor and later gained internship experience as a tax
                staff at an accounting firm, where I developed strong attention to
                detail and structured work habits.

                My growing interest in technology led me to explore web development,
                with a strong focus on Frontend Development. I enrolled in a Web
                Developer Bootcamp at Harisenin.com, specializing in frontend
                technologies, where I built several projects using React, JavaScript,
                and Next.js.

                I have a passion for learning new things, solving technical
                challenges, and collaborating with others to create clean, responsive,
                and user-friendly web interfaces. I am currently seeking opportunities
                as a Frontend Developer and am eager to grow while contributing
                meaningfully.
